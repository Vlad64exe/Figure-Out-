    If the code sucks, sorry, I'm just learning to code. If you have a code suggestion, it would be much appreciated.
Also, if you see that there is a better solution to the endless if statements I have in command.py, create a pull 
request at GitHub. If not then Yandere Dev will be proud;)

Cheers,
