# Figure-Out-
A simple Python text based game where you will figure out the answer for each question.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 difficulty levels namely, EASY, AVERAGE and DIFFICULT.

--SCORING SYSTEM--

If your answer is correct you will recieve the given points in the table:

EASY      | +1pts

AVERAGE   | +3pts

DIFFICULT | +5pts

If you answered each questions correctly you will have a total score of 14pts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
['Your score is: ', '|', '|', '|', '|||', '|||', '|||||']

This means you have a score of 14pts.
Each '|' or bar represents 1 point.

If the code sucks, sorry, I'm just learning to code. If you have a code suggestion, it would be much appreciated.
Also, if you see that there is a better solution to the endless if statements I have in command.py, create a pull 
request at GitHub.
If not then Yandere Dev will be proud;)

Cheers,
